## Project Overview

Stray Connect is not just a console application; it is a mission-driven platform designed to improve the lives of stray animals and promote community involvement. Built using Java, it serves as a digital bridge to facilitate animal adoption, foster care, donations, and pet registration. Through its comprehensive set of features, Stray Connect simplifies processes, reduces barriers to participation, and empowers individuals to make a difference.

Our primary goal is to address the plight of stray animals while leveraging technology to engage the community. Stray Connect aligns with **Sustainable Development Goal 15: Life on Land**, which underscores the importance of conserving biodiversity and fostering sustainable ecosystems. By integrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, Stray Connect ensures that the platform is robust, scalable, and ready to expand its impact on animal welfare and community collaboration.

## OOP Principles Applied

### 1. **Encapsulation**
- Data fields in the classes are declared as `private`, with controlled access provided through getters and setters. This ensures proper data handling and minimizes unintended changes to the internal state of objects.

```java
public class StrayAnimal {
    private String name;
    private String species;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getSpecies() {
        return species;
    }

    public void setSpecies(String species) {
        this.species = species;
    }
}
```

### 2. **Inheritance**
- Classes such as `StrayAnimal` and `Pet` inherit from a common parent class, demonstrating code reuse and hierarchical relationships.

```java
public abstract class Animal {
    private String name;

    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public abstract void displayInfo();
}

public class StrayAnimal extends Animal {
    private String species;

    public StrayAnimal(String name, String species) {
        super(name);
        this.species = species;
    }

    @Override
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + getName() + ", Species: " + species);
    }
}
```

### 3. **Polymorphism**
- Polymorphism is demonstrated through method overriding. For instance, the `displayInfo()` method in different subclasses provides unique implementations specific to each type of animal or user.

```java
public class Pet extends Animal {
    private String ownerName;

    public Pet(String name, String ownerName) {
        super(name);
        this.ownerName = ownerName;
    }

    @Override
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Pet Name: " + getName() + ", Owner: " + ownerName);
    }
}

Animal stray = new StrayAnimal("Loonie", "Dog");
Animal pet = new Pet("Mittens", "John Doe");

stray.displayInfo(); 
// Output: Name: Buddy, Species: Dog
pet.displayInfo();   
// Output: Pet Name: Mittens, Owner: John Doe
```

### 4. **Abstraction**
- Abstract classes and interfaces are used to hide implementation details while exposing essential functionalities. For example, an abstract class `Animal` is implemented by classes like `StrayAnimal` and `Pet` to define shared behavior.

```java
public interface Reportable {
    void generateReport();
}

public class AdoptionReport implements Reportable {
    @Override
    public void generateReport() {
        System.out.println("Generating adoption report...");
    }
}

public class DonationReport implements Reportable {
    @Override
    public void generateReport() {
        System.out.println("Generating donation report...");
    }
}

Reportable report = new AdoptionReport();
report.generateReport(); 
// Output: Generating adoption report...
```
